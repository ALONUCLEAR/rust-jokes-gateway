## What is this?

This is a very basic http server(most of the generic code copied directly from rust's documentation).
<br /> This server can do a few dummy operations, but the important part is that it acts as a gateway to the <a href="https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/" target="_blank">jokeapi</a>.

The only reason I'm not making the api call directly from a client, is that I wanted to build a server anyways, so making it a gateway saves me the trouble of looking for an interesting topic for the server.
